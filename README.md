# Programming Challenges
Demystifying the problem solving process one challenge at a time.
## Structure
This repository houses many folders, one for each programming challenge. Each folder contains:
1. `README.md` with a problem statement and a pseudocode solution
2. `.go` program(s) that, when run, should satisfy the requirements of the problem statement

## Why?
There are several tricks for solving most challenges, and Python is usually the language of choice. Why not learn the tricks while learning Go? This repository will serve as a well-documented reference for people who would like to follow along.
